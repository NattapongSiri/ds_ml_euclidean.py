# Example of using Keras to predict distance
This repository is created for learning purpose. It requires Keras, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, and Numpy. The purpose of this learning is to demonstrate how to properly create a prediction model using machine learning technique.

## Study guidance
What happen in this repository is:
1. inv.py - investigate the data by human mind (In practice, need domain expert)
2. train.py - experiment with multiple typeof neural network
3. test.py - generate comparison data to compare which network work best with data
4. comp_result.py - Visualize data to ease comparison
